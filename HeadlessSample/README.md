# WebWorks Headless Sample - File Communication

This sample shows how a front-end WebWorks application can include a native headless portion, which writes information to a file in the application's sandbox. This file is then read by the front-end application. In this example, information about incoming messages is logged in the file, then the file contents are displayed in the front-end.
